✨ I’m exploring AI, creative workflows, and thoughtful systems that make life feel calmer, effecient, and more enjoyable.  
This space is where curiosity meets intention — small experiments 🧪,  exploring/learning in public 👩🏽‍💻, and projects that evolve over time.

🧐 Currently interested in:
- AI as a creative and organizational partner
- Simple systems for home, life, and work
- Intuitive workflows 
- Continuous learning and growth 🌱

🍵 If you’re also exploring AI, creative systems, or  workflows,
feel free to say hello or share what you’re building.
