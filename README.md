## Hi, I’m Ampeachy 🍑

✨ Welcome to my cozy corner on GitHub.

I’m exploring AI, creative workflows, and thoughtful systems that make life feel calmer, effecient, and more enjoyable.  
This space is where curiosity meets intention — small experiments 🧪,  exploring/learning 👩🏽‍💻, and projects that grow over time.

🧐 Currently interested in:
- AI as a creative and organizational partner
- Simple systems for home, life, and work
- Calm, intuitive workflows 
- Learning and growth 🌱
