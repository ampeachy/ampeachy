## Hi, I’m Ampeachy 🍑

✨ Welcome to my cozy corner on GitHub.

I’m exploring AI, creative workflows, and thoughtful systems that make life feel calmer, effecient, and more enjoyable.  
This space is where curiosity meets intention — small experiments 🧪,  exploring/learning in public 👩🏽‍💻, and projects that evolve over time.

🧐 Currently interested in:
- AI as a creative and organizational partner
- Simple systems for home, life, and work
- Intuitive workflows 
- Continuous learning and growth 🌱

🍵 If you’re also exploring AI, creative systems, or  workflows,
feel free to say hello or share what you’re building.
